Implement heals using above like @heal and @temphp
Implement temporary hp
Allow for numerics when referencing weapons and spells by adding to an arsenal list
Mayyyybe convert all attacks and spells and weapons to be command strings in json using the above custom function
Then just start the grind of storing weapons etc in files as partials and storing the partials in enemies as well.
Global log returned for Nathan's code.
maybe instead of @ and ! for method and damage type I could use string that get's parsed like:
--landFudge "--dice 1d20 --method advantage --type fire"
start escaping quotes if this gets too deep like
\" \' \\\" \\\' and so on by 2^n -1
The method for storing weapons, spells, and items would be something like:
healing potion
do --weaponFudge 2d4+2@heal
greatsword
do --landFudge 1d20+str+martial --check ac --weaponFudge 2d6+str@slashing
firebolt
do --landFudge 1d20+spellhit --check ac --weaponFudge 1d20@fire
fireball
do --landFudge 1d20+dex --check spelldc --weaponFudge 8d6@fire --save
Some function let's call it form will use the above strings and modify them to fill in, replace or modify paramters
This will try to pull from an arsenal first, then it will pull from global? Not sure how to handle that as it would be a pain to modify both
form --use heal -t person
form --use greatsword -s person -t enemy -l 1d4 -w 2d8$ --method advantage
form --use firebolt -s person -t enemy
form --use fireball -s person -t enemies 
This form function is basically
run -p fireball -c "-s person -t enemies"
Now all I need is a wrapper around this and to start storing them in a less cluttered list than the battleinfo section

Problems with the above are that I need to add the ability to choose between appending to a parameter of the old dict, replacing a parameter of the old dict. This would simply be a --replace flag and would require all parameters to be set up how you want. otherwise everything would be additive. If you needed to simply add a method to the initial steps, you would fill in the -m parameter. like -m advantage like --method or -b advantage for --bonusmethod

Or simply bring back --advantage for this form function

use -d greatsword -s zanros -t goblin
This will check:
arsenal->global->action->weapon->spell
use an alternative to store
doable -p health-potion -c "do --weaponFudge 2d4+2@heal --target me"
arsenal -t doctor -p health-potion -c "do --weaponFudge 2d4+2@heal --target me"
maybe have a more permanent cache that can be edited for the above? Or just dump the battleInfo pretty.
deepmod
deepset
above two commands allow for making changes to the file they were pulled from and their temporary cache.
should auto and arsenal be the same command but simply have path default to autoDict?
