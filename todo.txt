for things like environmental hazards
custom --target climber --check (dex,ac,10) --damage 1d8@bludgeoning$ 2d8@heal
Implement heals using above like @heal and @temphp
Implement temporary hp
Allow for numerics when referencing weapons and spells by adding to an arsenal list
Mayyyybe convert all attacks and spells and weapons to be command strings in json using the above custom function
Then just start the grind of storing weapons etc in files as partials and storing the partials in enemies as well.
